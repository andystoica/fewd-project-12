# Treehouse FEWD - Project 12 - Online Portfolio

Requirements:
In this project you'll build an online portfolio to showcase the work you've created as part of this program and any projects you've built on your own. This is your chance to show the world (and potential employers) the work you've done. In fact, the portfolio site itself is a great way to show what you can do. Bring all of your talents with HTML, CSS and JavaScript together to create a fun and interactive online portfolio.

You'll host the portfolio site on the web either using a traditional web hosting company, or using free GitHub Pages hosting.
